# I. Project Overview

The repository is dedicated to an independent data science project, for completion of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. This project leverages the application of transfer learning on satellite image data. The task is to successfully predict the type of land coverage in a given satellite photo. The capacity to distinguish geographic features from satellite images can be essential for a variety of applications including environmental surveying, risk assessment, and urban planning. Using deep learning for the monitoring of land cover can streamline  tasks previously conducted by human analysts using bulkier GIS interfaces. 

### Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to create a solution that can classify an image as 1 of 10 different land covers. This will be achieved by  training a CNN to accurately and rapidly predict land cover labels for .jpg files. The end solution should be able to take an image file as an input, and produce the predicated class label and probability along with the inputted image. 

### Evaluation Metrics:
As this is a mutli-class problem, the evaluation metrics used in determining model performance will be Precision, Recall and a Macro-average F-beta score. I have set out to achieve a minimum Global F-score of 0.85 or greater. An F-beta

# II. Requirements & Dependencies:

- Python 3.x

- tensorflow==1.12.0

- keras==2.3.0

- flask==1.0.2

Model training was completed in a GPU-enabled Kaggle kernel.  

# III. Data:
Data is provided publicly by the Deutsches Forschungszentrum f端r K端nstliche Intelligenz (German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence). 

The dataset contains 27,000 64x64p Sentinel-2 Images in RGB mode of various land classifications. The dataset is divided into 10 class labels ranging from natural to urban geographic features. The data can be downloaded, and passing the path to the data's directory as an argument to preprocessing.py will split the dataset into training and testing directories, based on a provided 'test_size' argument. Class size distributions and labels are explored in the jupyter notebook.

Data must be downloaded at: http://madm.dfki.de/downloads

# V. Usage:
The repo contains command-line applications for training a model, and for predicting land cover in an input image using the trained model. The model can also be deployed as a simple REST API.

## a. Running train.py and predict.py:

1. download the data from http://madm.dfki.de/downloads from under the 'Datasets for Machine Learning' section. Data generator is titled 'EUROSAT (RGB color space images)'.

2. pass the path to the downloaded directory as argument to 'preprocessing.py', and a float representing the proportion of the data to use as a testing set

3. run train.py:

  - [-h] train_dir str, training set directory
  - [-h] test_dir str, testing set directory
  - [-h] save_path str, path to save trained model to
  - [--epochs] default=10, number of epochs for training
  - [--lr] default=0.01, learning rate
  - [--batch_size] default=64, batch size for image generators
  - [--fine_tune] default=True, turns on fine-tuning during the training process
  - [--eval] default=True, evaluate model performance on testing data. Display performance metrics

4. run predict.py:

  - [-h] input_path str, path to image file for prediction
  - [-h] model_path str, path to trained model
  
## b. Deploying model as REST API:

1. open a terminal in api subdirectory; enter 'flask run'

2. open a new terminal; enter 'python run_prediction.py [-h] PATH_TO_IMAGE.JPG
